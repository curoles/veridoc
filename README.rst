Veridoc - Verilog documentation generator
=========================================

I would NOT write *Veridoc* if *Doxygen* supported Verilog language, but alas.
*Veridoc* extracts bare minimum information from Verilog source file;
it extracts name of a *module*, names of ports and generic parameters.
Block comment immediately above declaration of *module* is treated
as a documentation of the module.

Find additional information and examples at https://curoles.github.io/veridoc/.
